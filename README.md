# Unity Projects
 
## This repo contains Unity's projects from my lessons and projects I've undertaken on my own. Many of them are part of [Unity learn patwhay][1], others are projects from many different courses like [Udemy][2] and [Dunki Code][3]. Furthermore some of my own creations have been included as well. 

## You can play and download them on [itch.io/thicosgroove][16]. Avaliable for windows and android.

## Here is the list organized respectively as it is displayed above. All of the items are part of a variety of knowledge I've acquired throughout the courses I've taken, even though in some cases I may have gotten carried away and ended up making a full featured game instead. ðŸ˜…
 
I chose to keep one repo for all my valued projects in one place. But you can check them out on their own git repo, where there's an individual readme file for each of them.
