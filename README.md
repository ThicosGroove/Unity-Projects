# Unity Projects
 
## This repo contains unity's projects for my lessons and projects of my own. Many of them are part of [Unity learn patwhay][1], others are projects from many different courses like [Udemy][2] and there's my own creations as well.

I preferred to keep one repo for all my valued projects in one place. But you can check them out on their own git repo, where there's an individual readme file for each one.
